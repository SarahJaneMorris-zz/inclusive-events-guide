# Events are a Joint Effort
</h1>
<span>We are blessed with a beautiful event space in the heart of downtown San Francisco that offers us a fantastic opportunity to build and foster community in the Bay Area. But, hosting events, while valuable for Keen, can be time consuming. From finding speakers/selecting activities, coordinating logistics like food and seating, and being generally empathetic to our visitors’ needs, there’s lots to consider. </span>

<span>Since we moved into this space, Community, Marketing and People have been working together to create fantastic events. We’ve experimented with meetups, lightning talks, happy hours and more (25+ HQ events since we moved here in July 2015!). In that time, we’ve gotten a better idea of what kinds of events benefit community team goals, marketing team goals, people team goals, as well as the goals of other Keen teams. The cross-functional nature of events makes them impactful across multiple teams and to the Keen brand overall, but certain event types naturally impact some team objectives over others. As we’ve moved into a period of introspection and focus at Keen, the Community team has developed a plan that still involves channeling organizational and staffing resources into events, but with a more intentional focus - past examples of the kinds of events we’ll continue to organize and channel team resources into include hosting </span><span class="c1"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesSF/events/232283508/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1475560659323000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFuifOj5Iu7qLus3CmGOau2JI6ARA" class="c0">PyLadies SF Data Science Lightning Talks</a></span><span>, organizing </span><span class="c1"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://opensourceshowandtell.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1475560659324000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEz0Rl2I6L4gxfv5xhhUWu-uW_oZA" class="c0">Open Source Show and Tell</a></span><span>, bringing a team of people to the </span><span class="c1"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1475560659325000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWXug4ell8Z5i0Vmf4DledJezbyw" class="c0">NASA Space Apps</a></span><span> hackathon, and hosting </span><span class="c1"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://keen.io/blog/150834478666/focus-on-allies-learning-ally-skills-at-keen-io&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1475560659325000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHbr2VLxzWBKMfXmDqyccAi_dueYA" class="c0">Focus on Allies.</a></span><span> Developers, inclusion and diversity and will be at the heart of the Community team’s event strategy for the next 6 months to a year, and possibly beyond.</span>
