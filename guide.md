# <span class="c13">Why Host Events?</span>

<span></span>

<span>Organizing and hosting events have been a core part of Keen IO’s community strategy since day one. Events are a fantastic way to grow, activate and retain your community members and are engaging for employees as well. Until last year, Keen was organizing and participating in events all over the world, but didn’t have our own event venue to call home. We moved into a beautiful office space in SoMa with a large events space in July 2015\. Since then, through trial and error and 25+ events in our office, we’ve learned a lot about what that means to host events in your own dedicated events space. It’s been an awesome journey, and we’re happy to share our knowledge.</span>

<span></span>

<span>Hosting events can be time consuming and resource intensive. From finding speakers/selecting activities, coordinating logistics like food and seating, and being empathetic to attendee wants/needs, there’s lots to consider.</span>

<span></span>

<span>The following is a guide to empower you to take the reigns and organize your own events in your office’s events space, grow and diversify your community, create a safe space, and thrill attendees! It will be especially helpful to startups without a dedicated events team. Assumptions are being made that you have proper A/V equipment, a place to store food, and supplies like folding chairs, tables, dedicated guest Wifi and gender neutral restrooms.</span>

<span></span>

<span>NB: This guide will contain some specifics to the Bay Area, and to Keen, but we’re hoping there’s plenty of valuable knowledge and resources that will make event planning easier and more successful for just about anyone!</span>

# <span class="c13">An Event Opportunity Knocks!</span>

<span>An event opportunity is on your radar. You think hosting this event would be awesome. Cool! Why? Does your event align with your company’s mission and values? Is this something you’d want to attend? Will your attendees have a great time and be glad they came?</span>

<span></span>

<span>If you think this event will be beneficial for your community and the events’ attendees themselves, your next step is to check or choose a date. If applicable, check your company events calendar to see what’s coming up.</span>

<span></span>

<span>Now that you have a date, let’s start going through planning!</span>

# <span class="c13">Tasklist: 3-4 Weeks (or more) before Event</span>

*   <span>Pick your event date</span>
*   <span>Book the time on your company’s event calendar</span>
*   <span>If you the event is open to employees, be sure to send a calendar invite to everyone in advance so everyone can be aware of and plan for the event.</span>
*   <span class="c10">To note:</span><span> Hosting events between 6-9 PM has worked well for us. It allows attendees enough time to arrive after work, and allows organizers to get out of the office once the event is done by 10 PM so no one gets burnt out.</span>
*   <span class="c10">Capacity.</span><span> Be sure you know your event space capacity in advance, so know what total registration numbers should be capped at.  Usually, you’ll get between 30% and half your registrations that will actually show up for the event.</span>
*   <span>Now’s a great time to</span> <span class="c10">secure resources</span><span>. Typically, a successful event requires a team of 5-6 (</span><span class="c11">[Emcee](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YwLgli6ib23niB22dPGiscrc5U5kLhd7KaVEs0O4R-8/edit&sa=D&ust=1475561008962000&usg=AFQjCNHEmalEYHEp7JlFX3QRapNilbKpsQ)</span><span>, “Stage Manager” to act as a speaker/sponsor resource and ensure everything is running smoothly, two folks to greet and welcome guests and keep the space clean and beer tub full, and one to two people to register guests at the and stay at the door). Send any volunteering internal resources a calendar request so they don’t forget their duties!</span>
*   <span>If you find yourself having trouble securing the team of 5-6 needed, consider allocating some budget to hiring</span> <span class="c11">[Taskrabbits](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.taskrabbit.com/&sa=D&ust=1475561008963000&usg=AFQjCNFwkk1bUZ-B9p34pRJsctfE0m0acg)</span><span> to help with event tasks, especially guest check-in/registration. We’ve successfully with worked with</span> <span class="c11">[Robert](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.taskrabbit.com/profile/robert-c--40&sa=D&ust=1475561008963000&usg=AFQjCNGCpmsLZRtFVEQBSjARvrIvvekk6Q)</span><span>,</span> <span class="c11">[Andre](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.taskrabbit.com/profile/andre-s&sa=D&ust=1475561008964000&usg=AFQjCNHWhxkqs2VfJekXg_i3_Yn9inFKSg)</span><span> and</span> <span class="c11">[Nini](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.taskrabbit.com/profile/niniv&sa=D&ust=1475561008964000&usg=AFQjCNEauXpINfDviEncWANDl9pPM42SpA)</span><span> out of SF for previous events.</span>

## <span>Speakers</span>

*   <span>Will your event feature any speaker(s)? Do you know who they are?</span>
*   <span>If you have a speaker, but would like more, please be mindful of featuring underrepresented speakers whenever possible. Women and people of color should comprise at least 33% of your speaker roster or panel (if 3/more people), ideally 50%.</span>
*   <span>If you have a speaker from your company, it’s always nice to add non-company speaker(s) to open the event up to a wider audience, grow your community and add to attendee value for your event.</span>
*   <span>A</span> <span class="c11">[great and growing resource](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/iheanyi/speakers-who-want-a-platform&sa=D&ust=1475561008968000&usg=AFQjCNHLAhotBWoNgDWzpjRgmNMlJTO38w) </span><span>for underrepresented speakers looking to speak!</span>

### <span class="c24">Eventbrite Page Creation</span>

*   <span>Once you’ve confirmed your speakers, we recommend using</span> <span class="c11">[Eventbrite](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://eventbrite.com&sa=D&ust=1475561008969000&usg=AFQjCNHfZ04zifu9HZa5zkoLrNj210EUAg)</span><span> to manage RSVPs .</span>
*   <span>Your Eventbrite page should contain the following information in something close to this order (check out our</span> <span class="c11">[past event](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.eventbrite.com/o/keen-io-6663825521&sa=D&ust=1475561008970000&usg=AFQjCNEMLz203jB39-1zI6x5q5mAX4Whgw)</span><span> pages for inspiration):</span>

*   <span class="c10">Brief description and pitch:</span><span> what overall topic is this event about? What is it about this topic that’s interesting to attendees? Why would they want to attend? What questions will be answered?</span>
*   <span class="c10">Speaker list:</span><span> Name, photo and short 3-4 sentence bio for each speaker</span>
*   <span class="c10">Agenda.</span> <span>This is where you can include information about food and drink (or lack thereof). Sample agenda:</span>

*   <span>6:00pm - 6:30pm: Drinks, nibbles and hobnobbing</span>
*   <span>6:30pm - 7:30pm: Talks from our speakers!</span>
*   <span>7:30pm - 8:00pm: Panel Q&A</span>
*   <span>8:00pm - 8:30pm: More drinks, nibbling and hobnobbery</span>

*   <span>Be sure to include a link to a</span> <span>Code of Conduct</span><span> (Keen’s can be found</span> <span class="c11">[here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/keen/community-code-of-conduct&sa=D&ust=1475561008975000&usg=AFQjCNGu9MeFqVrOk7-1rXY9h12tjKZ81g)</span><span>) with some contextual information. An example taken from our Focus on Allies talk in September 2016:</span>

*   <span class="c18">“Focus on Allies: Diversity and Inclusion for 2016 is an event for people from many different backgrounds. As such, all attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at this are required to agree with the</span> <span class="c11 c18">[Keen IO code of conduct](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/keen/community-code-of-conduct&sa=D&ust=1475561008976000&usg=AFQjCNHbeGNeWgltJ_OiZzv62_dN3hVuYQ)</span><span class="c18">.”</span>

*   <span>Be sure to clarify whether or not your events space is wheelchair friendly</span>
*   <span>Consider hiring ASL interpreters to make the event open to the hearing-impaired community! We have use</span><span class="c11">[ Linguabee](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.linguabee.com/&sa=D&ust=1475561008977000&usg=AFQjCNE08AbgQ0adN5qhxYkTZXUdQ7Bv0w)</span><span>, and they are fantastic!</span>
*   <span>Consider adding the following suggestion to your event copy: “In the spirit of fostering diversity and inclusion in tech, consider bringing a friend with that doesn’t look like you. Men, bring a friend that’s a woman. White folks, bring a POC friend. Cis/straight folks, bring a friend from the LGBTQ community. Able-bodied folks, bring a disabled friend.”</span>

*   <span class="c10">Eventbrite tips:</span>

*   <span class="c11">[Ensure your tickets are capped out at one ticket per name](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.eventbrite.com/support/articles/en_US/How_To/how-to-limit-how-many-tickets-one-attendee-can-purchase?lg%3Den_US&sa=D&ust=1475561008978000&usg=AFQjCNHUUYnGr4hJHi6U97ylkFKjGaDSkA)</span><span>, otherwise you run the risk of one person buying 20 tickets and showing up with 3 people.</span>
*   <span class="c11">[Ensure your ticket sale start and end dates correspond to your selling period and lead up to the day of your event.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.eventbrite.com/support/articles/en_US/How_To/how-to-change-the-start-end-date-and-time-for-ticket-sales?lg%3Den_US&sa=D&ust=1475561008979000&usg=AFQjCNGo0K2hzOpD5_UdEtLG1QmRTc4tNg)</span><span> Often, Eventbrite will default to weird dates here so it’s important to check this.</span>

### <span class="c24">Tracking your Promotional Efforts</span>

*   <span>If you like, you can create tracking links to measure your efforts in different promotional channels (email, twitter, etc). To do this:</span>

*   <span>Event Dashboard -> Scroll down to the bottom of the page -> Click on “Create your own tracking links”:</span>

<span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 108.00px;">![Screen Shot 2016-09-07 at 11.54.08 AM.png](images/image00.png)</span>

*   <span>Click on “Create a new tracking link” -> enter a memorable name for the promotional channel you’d like to track, click the “Create” button and fetch the tracking URL from the field above:</span>

<span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 221.33px;">![Screen Shot 2016-09-07 at 12.01.25 PM.png](images/image02.png)</span>

## <span>Promotion</span>

<span>Now that you have your event page and tracking URLs, go forth and promote!</span>

<span></span>

<span>Some tips:</span>

<span></span>

*   <span>If your company has an events calendar, be sure your event has been included.</span> <span class="c11">[Keen community calendar](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://keen.io/community&sa=D&ust=1475561008983000&usg=AFQjCNEU-xXxvSVaInFNzdbokb-LeWtubQ)</span><span>.</span>
*   <span>Tweet about the event. Try to get tweets coming out of your company twitter account if possible for greater reach!</span>
*   <span>Be sure to include speaker twitter handles, and any twitter handles for companies’ they work for - great way to ensure retweets!</span>
*   <span>Want to schedule some tweets? Add some cool graphics? Try getting few tweets scheduled through</span> <span class="c11">[Buffer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://buffer.com&sa=D&ust=1475561008985000&usg=AFQjCNFM9BIDdDvacn0pEv5IlryoCu8Nhw)</span><span>, and use their cool social image feature,</span> <span class="c11">[Pablo](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pablo.buffer.com/&sa=D&ust=1475561008986000&usg=AFQjCNE342bkXqS3yO1VcVyv4HA8nPc85Q)</span><span>. Tweets with</span> <span class="c11">[images](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/keen_io/status/775409902143545344&sa=D&ust=1475561008986000&usg=AFQjCNHMsNbtLAK2Cgf9oBXyg_r4vau2yg)</span><span> have been proven to be more engaging (more retweets, likes, etc.)</span>
*   <span>Search for and reach out to local, thematically-relevant</span> <span class="c11">[meetup group](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.meetup.com/&sa=D&ust=1475561008987000&usg=AFQjCNEgZHokCZeYdJ2Vey6eh7yx73P9tg)</span><span> organizers</span><span> for co-promotion. Lots of meetup groups are happy to share relevant events with their communities.</span>
*   <span>Reach out  and invite</span> <span class="c11">[underrepresented groups in tech](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://k-n.io/includeorgs&sa=D&ust=1475561008988000&usg=AFQjCNFAj-wWONoPbt6FHwjBmaqOr2nMUQ)</span><span>. Not only are they eager to hear about new events, expanding community to all kinds of folks will enrich it!</span>
*   <span>Ask your Marketing and Community teams if a limited email blast or inclusion in an upcoming newsletter might be relevant and timely for the existing customer and event community.</span>
*   <span>We typically see the majority of registrations happen within the last two weeks leading up to an event, so your best bet is to plan to push for registrations in the two weeks leading up to the event. Folks that register closer to the event are also more likely to show up!</span>

# <span class="c13">Tasklist: One Week Before Event</span>

*   <span>Reach out to your speaker(s) with an email:</span>

*   <span>Do they have what they need?</span>
*   <span>Can you get a sneak peek at their material? (nothing like a surprise offensive slide)</span>
*   <span>What kind of expectations do they have for tech specs: do they want to present off their own computers? If so, be sure to ask them to arrive early to have their presentation setup A/V checked on your equipment, and have them send you a backup of their presentation (ideally via PDF or Google drive for formatting consistency. Keynote and PowerPoint files sent over email are recipes for disaster)</span>
*   <span>Ask if they have their own “clicker” to navigate through slides or will need ours (be sure to have one in office, at Keen we use</span> <span class="c11">[this one](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdw.com/shop/products/Logitech-Wireless-Presenter-R400-presentation-remote-control/1831321.aspx?cm_cat%3DGoogleBase%26cm_ite%3D1831321%26cm_pla%3DNA-NA-LOG_JA%26cm_ven%3Dacquirgy%26ef_id%3DV4nHBwAABYZLpDC7:20160930170026:s%26gclid%3DCLbN277It88CFYJYfgodIyUEmw%26s_kwcid%3DAL!4223!3!47988633259!!!g!107886137299!&sa=D&ust=1475561008991000&usg=AFQjCNGjXykpFxYGvEEPmoG2rsIXdMSlbw)</span><span> that has worked on all machines we’ve connected it to)</span>
*   <span>Encourage speakers to send their slides via Google Drive or Dropbox by noon of the event day, and run all presentations off one machine. This prevents awkward pauses and potential technical glitches when switching computers between speakers.</span>
*   <span>Know the specifics for your projector. At Keen, our projector connects easily with Macbooks with thunderbolt ports or HDMI (99% of Bay Area speakers are compatible with this). Speakers may need to provide dongles for any other configuration.</span>

*   <span>Book some time with your designated</span> <span class="c11">[emcee](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YwLgli6ib23niB22dPGiscrc5U5kLhd7KaVEs0O4R-8/edit&sa=D&ust=1475561008992000&usg=AFQjCNHlfE7za6nMwPr_mVVrVc_YDCkwvA)</span><span> to make sure they are feeling comfortable about their content (see our emcee guide in the hyperlink)</span>
*   <span>If applicable, plan to briefly introduce your company and product to the audience before the speakers begin. (</span><span class="c11">[Sample slides here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dropbox.com/s/kujtqztm3cou4dk/SampleEventIntroSlides.key?dl%3D0&sa=D&ust=1475561008993000&usg=AFQjCNHB_HdAm1kQyZr8wOnjG4CfZ3XFyQ)</span><span>)</span>
*   <span>How are your registration numbers looking?</span>

*   <span>Always assume that for any free event (and 99% of events held in your space should be free, assuming you are looking to build community, not make money off of events), you will have anywhere between a 30-50% attendance rate.</span>
*   <span>Registration goals should therefore account for this. If you’d like to see 50 attendees, plan to promote until you’ve hit 100-150 registrants.</span>

*   <span>Ensure you have plenty of nametags and sharpies for attendees to write out their names! Order some if needed. Nametags are cheesy but legitimately great networking/icebreaking tools.</span>
*   <span>Consider how many t-shirts stickers, etc you’d like to distribute, if you’d like to hand out swag, and ensure you have stock available in office.</span>

# <span class="c13">Tasklist: 3-4 Days Before - Catering the Event</span>

*   <span>You should have an idea by 3-4 days prior to the event of where your numbers are headed, so start to consider</span><span class="c10"> catering options. Please note, the vendors recommended are rather specific to San Francisco.</span>

*   <span>No matter your budget, diverse dietary needs should be accommodated: vegan, vegetarian, gluten free.</span>
*   <span>If you have budget, consider fine catering from</span> <span class="c11">[Bi-Rite](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.biritemarket.com/catering/&sa=D&ust=1475561008996000&usg=AFQjCNEhcj1lsqu3p5tVLhzWitcnCYMvZw)</span><span>, which gets excellent attendee feedback and leaves people full, healthy and happy. Apprx $1500 to feed 100 people.</span>
*   <span>A great mid-tier budget option is</span> <span class="c11">[La Mediteranee](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://eat24hrs.com/restaurants/order2/menu.php?id%3D34862&sa=D&ust=1475561008996000&usg=AFQjCNHubnWOCKTFTH9JwU1zhNBEuPB7Ww)</span><span>, feed 100 people for $900\.</span>
*   <span>If you have less of a budget, you still have options. Try</span> <span class="c11">[EZCater](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ezcater.com&sa=D&ust=1475561008997000&usg=AFQjCNFQDq11mGNe_DxiPRMaTmM8soc6hg)</span><span> (available in most large US cities)</span><span> for tacos or many other options.</span> <span class="c11">[Pizza](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://goathill.com/&sa=D&ust=1475561008998000&usg=AFQjCNHSn6XV6i8x0j0V6DipfOs7bL6-xg)</span><span> is fine every now and again, just be sure to order several varieties and include a gluten free pie for every 50 or so guests. You can also include salad options with pizza.</span> <span class="c11">[Empanadas](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.vengaempanadas.com/&sa=D&ust=1475561008998000&usg=AFQjCNFlJWV_JUZ_YbUqlBG0NoK_CO8M2Q)</span><span> also work well.</span>
*   <span>Plan to offer a large selection of non-alcoholic beverages (water, juices, LaCroix, diet and regular sodas) as well as wine and beer (hard alcohol at public events can be a slippery slope and is generally not recommended in most circumstances). See below under “Day Of” for sample recommended Instacart order.</span>
*   <span>Food vendor orders should also include plates/utensils wherever possible, make sure you specify when ordering.</span>
*   <span>Don’t forget to remember ice!</span>

# <span class="c13">Tasklist: 2 Days Before Event</span>
